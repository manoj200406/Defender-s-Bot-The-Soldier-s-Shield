# Face Recognition Project

This project is a basic implementation of **Face Recognition using OpenCV** in Python. It includes data collection, training a recognizer, and identifying faces in real-time using Haar Cascades.

## üìÅ Folder Structure

| Name                                  | Type        | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `dataset/`                            | Folder      | Stores the collected face images for each person.                                    |
| `trainer/`                            | Folder      | Stores the trained model file generated by the training script.                      |
| `Desktop/`                            | Folder      | Not part of the project. Possibly synced folder.                                     |
| `face_datasets.py`                    | Python File | Script to collect face samples from the webcam and store them in the dataset folder. |
| `face_recognition.py`                 | Python File | Script to recognize faces using the trained model.                                   |
| `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` | XML File    | Haar Cascade classifier for face detection (used by OpenCV).                         |
| `names.xlsx`                          | Excel File  | Contains the mapping of user IDs to names (used for labeling recognized faces).      |
| `training.py`                         | Python File | Script to train the LBPH face recognizer on collected data.                          |

## üíª How to Use

1. **Collect Face Data**
   Run `face_datasets.py` to capture face samples from webcam.

2. **Train the Model**
   Run `training.py` to train the recognizer and save the model in the `trainer/` folder.

3. **Recognize Faces**
   Run `face_recognition.py` to detect and recognize faces in real time.

## üì¶ Requirements

* Python
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Pandas (for Excel file handling)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy pandas
```
